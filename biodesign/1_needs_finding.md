# PART I: Identify
## Stage 1: Needs Finding 

### Strategic Focus 
- **Discover and commit to the strategic focus area that stimulates personal enthusiasm** By explicitly deciding in what areas to focus, innovators accept different risks, challenges and potential rewards
- the most rewarding and successful biodesign projects are those that achieve a high degree of alignment
in choosing a strategic focus.

**Determining a Strategic Focus Involves**
- deciding what the innovator or organization values/wants to achieve, independent of any specific vehicle or project for accomplishing it 
- Accurately assessing what competencies the innovator or the organization have (or do not have) that will affect the ability to realize those goals.
- And then translating these insights into criteria that can be used to objectively evaluate opportunities and decide which problems or focus areas to pursue.

**Begin by Conducting a Personal Inventory**
- personal inventory should be performed before the innovator begins thinking about any particular opportunity or problem area
- **Determining a mission**: A mission is a broad, directional aspiration that defines what an individual or group wants to accomplish.
  - To define a mission, individuals and groups should think about their priorities, beginning with questions about what is most important to them (or, conversely, not important to them) 
- **Define Strengths and Weaknesses**
  - Fundamentally, the most important objective of this step is to identify where certain competency gaps and opportunities exist so that the innovator can address them when the time is right. 

**Defining Acceptance Criteria**
- acceptance criteria are conditions that must be met to make an innovation project attractive to the innovator based on what the innovators have learned about themselves by conducting the personal inventory and considering the external environment (regulatory, reimbursement, access to capital, etc)
- no one size fits all set of acceptance criteria; however, common themes include: 
    - fit with innovator's mission and capabilities, effect on improving health outcomes, effect on affordability/accessibility of care, time/resources required to achieve results, customers that need to be cultivated, revenue/market size targets, anticipated market growth, market dynamics and competition 
  - **aside:** [Choosing a project](https://bitsandbrains.io/2018/08/31/sig-and-feas.html)
    - **Feasibility**
      - The probability that you can complete the project given your current resources/constraints.
      - resources include background knowledge, knowledge you have access to, collaborators
      - constraints include time and energy
    - **Significance**
       -How important , for the world, successful completion of the project will be
      - Significance = # of people impacted x impact per person
    - **Intrinsic Motivation**
      - The more intrinsic motivation you have the more likely you are able to complete the project excellently
- example acceptance criteria: 
  - has a total potential market of $1 B or more
  - technologies in this space have a relatively well understood regulatory pathway 
  - significantly expand access to healthcare in areas where treatments exist but have been previously unaffordable 
  
**Evaluating opportunities against acceptance criteria**
- Innovators are encouraged to consider a broad range of possibilities, keeping in mind that deep expertise in a field is not necessarily required. Diverse experiences and backgrounds can be more successful in uncovering opportunities because they are more willing to question status quo 
- One approach is to start by evaluating problems and opportunities related to a personal interest or passion. However, be prepared to walk away if significant gaps are uncovered between the acceptance criteria and the area being explored.
- another way to begin the process of screening potential focus areas against their acceptance criteria is to examine high-level data related to a practice area or disease state
- Statistics to consider include the number of people affected by a condition, the clinical impact of the disease, the out- comes and costs of existing treatments, the profitability of existing treatments, and the rate at which spending is growing 

**Global Considerations in Choosing a Strategic Focus**
- The fundamental process for choosing a strategic focus is the same regardless of location but innovators are encouraged to make their geographic focus an explicit part of their internal and external analysis before making a decision.
- Innovators exploring strategic focus areas in emerging markets face an increased level of risk (IP, regulatory, familiarity w/ market)
- A critical aspect of the biodesign innovation process is the ability to gain a deep understanding and a true sense of empathy for the patients being targeted, no matter where they are located.
