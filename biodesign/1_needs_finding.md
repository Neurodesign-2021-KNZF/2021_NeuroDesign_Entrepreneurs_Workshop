# PART I: Identify
## Stage 1: Needs Finding 

### Strategic Focus 
- **Discover and commit to the strategic focus area that stimulates personal enthusiasm** By explicitly deciding in what areas to focus, innovators accept different risks, challenges and potential rewards
- the most rewarding and successful biodesign projects are those that achieve a high degree of alignment
in choosing a strategic focus.

**Determining a Strategic Focus Involves**
- deciding what the innovator or organization values/wants to achieve, independent of any specific vehicle or project for accomplishing it 
- Accurately assessing what competencies the innovator or the organization have (or do not have) that will affect the ability to realize those goals.
- And then translating these insights into criteria that can be used to objectively evaluate opportunities and decide which problems or focus areas to pursue.

**Begin by Conducting a Personal Inventory**
- personal inventory should be performed before the innovator begins thinking about any particular opportunity or problem area
- **Determining a mission**: A mission is a broad, directional aspiration that defines what an individual or group wants to accomplish.
  - To define a mission, individuals and groups should think about their priorities, beginning with questions about what is most important to them (or, conversely, not important to them) 
- **Define Strengths and Weaknesses**
  - Fundamentally, the most important objective of this step is to identify where certain competency gaps and opportunities exist so that the innovator can address them when the time is right.
