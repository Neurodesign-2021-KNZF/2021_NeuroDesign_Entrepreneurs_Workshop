Notes from [*Biodesign: The Process of Innovating Medical Technologies* pgs 1-46](https://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/engineering/biomedical-engineering/biodesign-process-innovating-medical-technologies-2nd-edition?format=HB)
## Introduction
### Focus on Value 
- Value is an expression of the improvement a new technology offers relative to incremental cost. Value is not realized unless there is enough marginal benefit over other available solutions
- The assessment of value is evolving from being product specific to outcomes oriented 
- How can innovators practically adress value in the design, development, and commercialization of medtech?
  - **Value exploration**: Early in the process innovators should actively seek need areas ripe for value realization. Investigate *budget-based value signposts*: extreme variations in treatments across geopgraphies, cost-effectiveness of existing treatments, other economic signals
  - **Value estimate**: After identifying promising needs, innovators can develop directional estimates of the value associated with their needs to make sure it is worth moving forward in concept generation
  - **Value proposition**: the net impact of the cost/improvement equation associated with a new offering. Must be backed by strong evidence that resonates with decision makers and the influencers that surround them
 
### Process Insights
- **Identify**:  needs finding and needs screening 
  - **Biodesign innovation is driven by a compelling need**: recognize an unmet clinical need, then move on to invention. Even if you start with a technology, you still need to figure out the need
  - **Pay attention to value up front**: focus on cost as well as outcome of care to determine if there is sufficient margin to develop a new technology
  - **Let needs compete to survive**: start with a large set of potential needs and progressively cut down the list through needs screening
  - **Multitask and iterate**:loop back and forth between needs finding and needs screening 
  - **Start with a sketch**: resist the temptation to go too deep in detail too quickly. Understanding of a need grows progressively, similar to a piece of art that starts with a sketch
 - **Invent**: concept generation and concept screening 
    - **What you learned during identify will guide you through Invent**: need spec provides an objective set of criteria against which you can evaluate competing solutions to ensure that your final concept truly addresses the most important aspects of the need.
    - **Keep cycling**: processof generating and screening concepts is iterative, not linear
    - **Never change a need to suit a concept**: Use the need specification to help you stay clear-headed.
    - **Let the concepts compete**: learn enough about your concepts to be able to drop the ones that have major flaws. Over time you’ll gravitate to the final concept that objectively wins out over all others.
 - **Implement**: strategy development and business planning
    - **The end is only the beginning** By the end of Implement, you should be on a clear trajectory to launch
    - **Prioritize your risks: identify the key questions**: prioritize risks with an emphasis on determining the one or two most critical issues that must be addressed first in order for the project to remain viable
    - **Maintain a value-orientation**: the clearer and more compelling the value of the new solution, the greater its likelihood of commercial success.
    - **There's more than one way to deliver a new technology to patients**: the more effectively you can demonstrate that your product has a clear path to market, the easier it will be for investors, licensors, partners, or acquirers to appreciate the opportunity enabled by your offering.
    - **Tell and Sell your story**: A well-crafted story is essential for justifying the time, capital, and other resources you’ll need to execute your plan
    - **Get comfortable making assumptions**: Learn to make and work with reasonable assumptions until better information becomes available, otherwise you risk becoming paralyzed by uncertainty.
    - **Ask for help**: there’s no substitute for experience

### Global Perspectives 
- **Africa**
  - challenges: African markets are smaller, riskier, and therefore less attractive for private companies to invest, limited physical infrastructure
  - tactics: provide a complete, affordable, robust solution, partnerships are key, innovative funding models
- **China**
  - challenges: navigating rules set by regulators and government agencies, product distribution, developing in-country relationships, protecting of IP
  - tactics: Relationships are key (hospitals, CFDA, government),consider barriers to entry/compettitors, consider pros and cons of being an outsider 
- **Europe**
  - challenges: reimbursement/payment for new devices, coverage must be negotiated separately with payers in each country 
  - tactics:appreciate country-specific differences, be prepared to demonstrate value, leverage european activities for global market entry (europe frequently facilitates earlier market entry than the US)
- **India**
  - challenges: imports account for 80% of the value of all devices sold within India, much of which may niot appropriately address needs, distribution and business models need to be sustainable, business model innovation is difficult 
  - tactics:search for needs in country, go deep on stakeholder analysis, keep innovating beyon the technology
- **Japan**
  - challenges: language barrier, not all forms and guidelines are readily available in other languages, companies must often depend on CRO's,Device regulation throught PMDA is lengthy, extensive documentation, relatively few innovations in medtech, more R&D focused
  - tactics:credibility/support matters, actively leverage in country connections, plan ahead when it comes to regulation, take into account patent, clinical trial, regulatory possibly burdensome
- **Latin America**
  - challenges: Countries are incredibly diverse, offering significantly different levels of opportunity, stability, competitiveness, regulatory approval can be confusing/unexplained delays, IP protection
  - tactics:conduct an in-market experiment, establish a foundation in a single market (Brazil or Mexico), then expand, capitalize on government incentives
